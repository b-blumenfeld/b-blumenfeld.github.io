> ***"Music may not be described as the mathematics of the sense, mathematics as music of the reason? The musician feels mathematics, the mathematics thinks music: music the dream, mathematics the working life.” - James Joseph Sylvester"***

When I started studying music in college, the last thing that I thought about was the data behind the lyrics and notes that could transform my mood and take me into another world in an instant. Sure, I knew that data and music were connected, but what I did not realize was just how passionate I would become about not only the end result of hearing my favorite song on television, radio and in movies, but also every element that brought the music to me.

**Why Now?**

I have always wanted to understand just how music “works.”  From the moment an artist creates a song, data becomes the most prominent aspect.  Every song uses a pattern of chords and intervals that are both pleasant to the ear and filled with elements that can be evaluated.  Once an artist is signed, their song splits need to be collected and registered and added to a system that will use a series of formulas and equations to pay the artist properly. Streaming platforms provide not only payments per stream, but also recommendations that introduce the listener to new artists and help those new artists continue to make a living. These platforms are also developing new ways for writers, publishers, and labels view and locate their music for payment and assist in the understanding of trends in the industry that help identify what both artists and fans really want.  As I’ve taken positions in music publishing and distribution I’ve learned that everything boils down to the one thing that makes the most sense to me, the underlying data.

**The Future Is Data**

While I’ve continued to dig myself into a further hole of understanding how data relates to my current industry, I’ve realized that the need for this information, formula processing and predictive trends is everywhere.  Every time Netflix tells me what I would want to watch next, that’s data based on my past viewings.  Online stores are able to tell me what I want to purchase before I even know what I want.  The broadcasters of the movies that I watch utilize audience data and research to understand which trailers should be shown ahead of time.  Data evaluation is teaching me what I want before I’m able to decide on my own, which is both scary and amazing. 

**What Now?**

Now I want to be a part of what’s next.  Whether it is in music or in another industry, I want to research big data to draw conclusions that can help the individual or the masses.  I want to create visualizations that can change a company or persons’ way of thought.  This all boils down to one thing, learning data science, and I cannot wait to see where this new journey takes me.
